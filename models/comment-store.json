Yellow, black.\r\nYellow, black. Yellow, black.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOoh, black and yellow!\r\nLet's shake it up a little.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry! Breakfast is ready!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOoming!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHang on a second.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHello?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Barry?\r\n- Adam?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Oan you believe this is happening?\r\n- I can't. I'll pick you up.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLooking sharp.\r\n\r\n  \r\nUse the stairs. Your father\r\npaid good money for those.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSorry. I'm excited.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHere's the graduate.\r\nWe're very proud of you, son.\r\n\r\n  \r\nA perfect report card, all B's.\r\n\r\n  \r\nVery proud.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMa! I got a thing going here.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You got lint on your fuzz.\r\n- Ow! That's me!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.\r\n- Bye!\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, I told you,\r\nstop flying in the house!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hey, Adam.\r\n- Hey, Barry.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Is that fuzz gel?\r\n- A little. Special day, graduation.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNever thought I'd make it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThree days grade school,\r\nthree days high school.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThose were awkward.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThree days college. I'm glad I took\r\na day and hitchhiked around the hive.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou did come back different.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hi, Barry.\r\n- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hear about Frankie?\r\n- Yeah.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You going to the funeral?\r\n- No, I'm not going.\r\n\r\n  \r\nEverybody knows,\r\nsting someone, you die.\r\n\r\n  \r\nDon't waste it on a squirrel.\r\nSuch a hothead.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI guess he could have\r\njust gotten out of the way.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI love this incorporating\r\nan amusement park into our day.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's why we don't need vacations.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBoy, quite a bit of pomp...\r\nunder the circumstances.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Well, Adam, today we are men.\r\n- We are!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Bee-men.\r\n- Amen!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHallelujah!\r\n\r\n  \r\nStudents, faculty, distinguished bees,\r\n\r\n  \r\nplease welcome Dean Buzzwell.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWelcome, New Hive Oity\r\ngraduating class of...\r\n\r\n  \r\n...9:15.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat concludes our ceremonies.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd begins your career\r\nat Honex Industries!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWill we pick ourjob today?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI heard it's just orientation.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHeads up! Here we go.\r\n\r\n  \r\nKeep your hands and antennas\r\ninside the tram at all times.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Wonder what it'll be like?\r\n- A little scary.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWelcome to Honex,\r\na division of Honesco\r\n\r\n  \r\nand a part of the Hexagon Group.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is it!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWow.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWow.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe know that you, as a bee,\r\nhave worked your whole life\r\n\r\n  \r\nto get to the point where you\r\ncan work for your whole life.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHoney begins when our valiant Pollen\r\nJocks bring the nectar to the hive.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOur top-secret formula\r\n\r\n  \r\nis automatically color-corrected,\r\nscent-adjusted and bubble-contoured\r\n\r\n  \r\ninto this soothing sweet syrup\r\n\r\n  \r\nwith its distinctive\r\ngolden glow you know as...\r\n\r\n  \r\nHoney!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- That girl was hot.\r\n- She's my cousin!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- She is?\r\n- Yes, we're all cousins.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Right. You're right.\r\n- At Honex, we constantly strive\r\n\r\n  \r\nto improve every aspect\r\nof bee existence.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThese bees are stress-testing\r\na new helmet technology.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What do you think he makes?\r\n- Not enough.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHere we have our latest advancement,\r\nthe Krelman.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What does that do?\r\n- Oatches that little strand of honey\r\n\r\n  \r\nthat hangs after you pour it.\r\nSaves us millions.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOan anyone work on the Krelman?\r\n\r\n  \r\nOf course. Most bee jobs are\r\nsmall ones. But bees know\r\n\r\n  \r\nthat every small job,\r\nif it's done well, means a lot.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut choose carefully\r\n\r\n  \r\nbecause you'll stay in the job\r\nyou pick for the rest of your life.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe same job the rest of your life?\r\nI didn't know that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat's the difference?\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou'll be happy to know that bees,\r\nas a species, haven't had one day off\r\n\r\n  \r\nin 27 million years.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo you'll just work us to death?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe'll sure try.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWow! That blew my mind!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\"What's the difference?\"\r\nHow can you say that?\r\n\r\n  \r\nOne job forever?\r\nThat's an insane choice to have to make.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm relieved. Now we only have\r\nto make one decision in life.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut, Adam, how could they\r\nnever have told us that?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhy would you question anything?\r\nWe're bees.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're the most perfectly\r\nfunctioning society on Earth.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou ever think maybe things\r\nwork a little too well here?\r\n\r\n  \r\nLike what? Give me one example.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't know. But you know\r\nwhat I'm talking about.\r\n\r\n  \r\nPlease clear the gate.\r\nRoyal Nectar Force on approach.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait a second. Oheck it out.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!\r\n- Wow.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI've never seen them this close.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey know what it's like\r\noutside the hive.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah, but some don't come back.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hey, Jocks!\r\n- Hi, Jocks!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou guys did great!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou're monsters!\r\nYou're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- I wonder where they were.\r\n- I don't know.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTheir day's not planned.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOutside the hive, flying who knows\r\nwhere, doing who knows what.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou can'tjust decide to be a Pollen\r\nJock. You have to be bred for that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRight.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLook. That's more pollen\r\nthan you and I will see in a lifetime.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's just a status symbol.\r\nBees make too much of it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nPerhaps. Unless you're wearing it\r\nand the ladies see you wearing it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThose ladies?\r\nAren't they our cousins too?\r\n\r\n  \r\nDistant. Distant.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLook at these two.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Oouple of Hive Harrys.\r\n- Let's have fun with them.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt must be dangerous\r\nbeing a Pollen Jock.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah. Once a bear pinned me\r\nagainst a mushroom!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe had a paw on my throat,\r\nand with the other, he was slapping me!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Oh, my!\r\n- I never thought I'd knock him out.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat were you doing during this?\r\n\r\n  \r\nTrying to alert the authorities.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI can autograph that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nA little gusty out there today,\r\nwasn't it, comrades?\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah. Gusty.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're hitting a sunflower patch\r\nsix miles from here tomorrow.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Six miles, huh?\r\n- Barry!\r\n\r\n  \r\nA puddle jump for us,\r\nbut maybe you're not up for it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Maybe I am.\r\n- You are not!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're going 0900 at J-Gate.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat do you think, buzzy-boy?\r\nAre you bee enough?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI might be. It all depends\r\non what 0900 means.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHey, Honex!\r\n\r\n  \r\nDad, you surprised me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou decide what you're interested in?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Well, there's a lot of choices.\r\n- But you only get one.\r\n\r\n  \r\nDo you ever get bored\r\ndoing the same job every day?\r\n\r\n  \r\nSon, let me tell you about stirring.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou grab that stick, and you just\r\nmove it around, and you stir it around.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou get yourself into a rhythm.\r\nIt's a beautiful thing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou know, Dad,\r\nthe more I think about it,\r\n\r\n  \r\nmaybe the honey field\r\njust isn't right for me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou were thinking of what,\r\nmaking balloon animals?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's a bad job\r\nfor a guy with a stinger.\r\n\r\n  \r\nJanet, your son's not sure\r\nhe wants to go into honey!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.\r\n- I'm not trying to be funny.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou're not funny! You're going\r\ninto honey. Our son, the stirrer!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You're gonna be a stirrer?\r\n- No one's listening to me!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait till you see the sticks I have.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI could say anything right now.\r\nI'm gonna get an ant tattoo!\r\n\r\n  \r\nLet's open some honey and celebrate!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMaybe I'll pierce my thorax.\r\nShave my antennae.\r\n\r\n  \r\nShack up with a grasshopper. Get\r\na gold tooth and call everybody \"dawg\"!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm so proud.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- We're starting work today!\r\n- Today's the day.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOome on!

If we didn't laugh,\r\nwe'd cry with what we have to deal with.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnyway...\r\n\r\n  \r\nOan I...\r\n\r\n  \r\n...get you something?\r\n- Like what?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't know.

I know that area.\r\nI lost a toe ring there once.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Why do girls put rings on their toes?\r\n- Why not?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- It's like putting a hat on your knee.\r\n- Maybe I'll try that.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You all right, ma'am?\r\n- Oh, yeah. Fine.\r\n\r\n  \r\nJust having two cups of coffee!\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnyway, this has been great.\r\nThanks for the coffee.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah, it's no trouble.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSorry I couldn't finish it.

That was nothing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWell, not nothing, but... Anyway...\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis can't possibly work.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe's all set to go.\r\nWe may as well try it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOK, Dave, pull the chute.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Sounds amazing.\r\n- It was amazing!\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt was the scariest,\r\nhappiest moment of my life.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHumans!

But some of them don't.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- How'd you get back?\r\n- Poodle.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou did it, and I'm glad. You saw\r\nwhatever you wanted to see.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou had your \"experience.\" Now you\r\ncan pick out yourjob and be normal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Well...\r\n- Well?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWell, I met someone.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou did? Was she Bee-ish?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!\r\n- No, no, no, not a wasp.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Spider?\r\n- I'm not attracted to spiders.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know it's the hottest thing,\r\nwith the eight legs and all.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI can't get by that face.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo who is she?\r\n\r\n  \r\nShe's... human.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo, no. That's a bee law.\r\nYou wouldn't break a bee law.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Her name's Vanessa.\r\n- Oh, boy.\r\n\r\n  \r\nShe's so nice. And she's a florist!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, no! You're dating a human florist!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're not dating.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou're flying outside the hive, talking\r\nto humans that attack our homes\r\n\r\n  \r\nwith power washers and M-80s!\r\nOne-eighth a stick of dynamite!\r\n\r\n  \r\nShe saved my life!\r\nAnd she understands me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is over!\r\n\r\n  \r\nEat this.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is not over! What was that?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- They call it a crumb.\r\n- It was so stingin' stripey!\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd that's not what they eat.\r\nThat's what falls off what they eat!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You know what a Oinnabon is?\r\n- No.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's bread and cinnamon and frosting.\r\nThey heat it up...\r\n\r\n  \r\nSit down!\r\n\r\n  \r\n...really hot!\r\n- Listen to me!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe are not them!

I try not\r\nto use the competition.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo why are you helping me?\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees have good qualities.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd it takes my mind off the shop.\r\n\r\n  \r\nInstead of flowers, people\r\nare giving balloon bouquets now.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThose are great, if you're three.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd artificial flowers.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Oh, those just get me psychotic!\r\n- Yeah, me too.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBent stingers, pointless pollination.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees must hate those fake things!\r\n\r\n  \r\nNothing worse\r\nthan a daffodil that's had work done.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMaybe this could make up\r\nfor it a little bit.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.\r\n- I guess.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou sure you want to go through with it?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAm I sure? When I'm done with\r\nthe humans, they won't be able\r\n\r\n  \r\nto say, \"Honey, I'm home,\"\r\nwithout paying a royalty!\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's an incredible scene\r\nhere in downtown Manhattan,\r\n\r\n  \r\nwhere the world anxiously waits,\r\nbecause for the first time in history,\r\n\r\n  \r\nwe will hear for ourselves\r\nif a honeybee can actually speak.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat have we gotten into here, Barry?\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's pretty big, isn't it?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI can't believe how many humans\r\ndon't work during the day.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou think billion-dollar multinational\r\nfood companies have good lawyers?\r\n\r\n  \r\nEverybody needs to stay\r\nbehind the barricade.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What's the matter?\r\n- I don't know, I just got a chill.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWell, if it isn't the bee team.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou boys work on this?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll rise!

Ventriloquism!\r\nOloning! For all we know,\r\n\r\n  \r\nhe could be on steroids!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Benson?\r\n\r\n  \r\nLadies and gentlemen,\r\nthere's no trickery here.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm just an ordinary bee.\r\nHoney's pretty important to me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's important to all bees.\r\nWe invented it!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe make it. And we protect it\r\nwith our lives.\r\n\r\n  \r\nUnfortunately, there are\r\nsome people in this room\r\n\r\n  \r\nwho think they can take it from us\r\n\r\n  \r\n'cause we're the little guys!\r\nI'm hoping that, after this is all over,\r\n\r\n  \r\nyou'll see how, by taking our honey,\r\nyou not only take everything we have\r\n\r\n  \r\nbut everything we are!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI wish he'd dress like that\r\nall the time. So nice!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOall your first witness.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden\r\nof Honey Farms, big company you have.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI suppose so.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI see you also own\r\nHoneyburton and Honron!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYes, they provide beekeepers\r\nfor our farms.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBeekeeper. I find that\r\nto be a very disturbing term.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't imagine you employ\r\nany bee-free-ers, do you?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- No.\r\n- I couldn't hear you.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- No.\r\n- No.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBecause you don't free bees.\r\nYou keep bees. Not only that,\r\n\r\n  \r\nit seems you thought a bear would be\r\nan appropriate image for a jar of honey.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey're very lovable creatures.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou mean like this?\r\n\r\n  \r\nBears kill bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow'd you like his head crashing\r\nthrough your living room?!\r\n\r\n  \r\nBiting into your couch!\r\nSpitting out your throw pillows!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOK, that's enough. Take him away.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.\r\nYour name intrigues me.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Where have I heard it before?\r\n- I was with a band called The Police.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut you've never been\r\na police officer, have you?\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo, I haven't.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo, you haven't. And so here\r\nwe have yet another example\r\n\r\n  \r\nof bee culture casually\r\nstolen by a human\r\n\r\n  \r\nfor nothing more than\r\na prance-about stage name.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, please.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHave you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?\r\n\r\n  \r\nBecause I'm feeling\r\na little stung, Sting.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOr should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's not his real name?! You idiots!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Liotta, first,\r\nbelated congratulations on\r\n\r\n  \r\nyour Emmy win for a guest spot\r\non ER in 2005.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThank you.

Is that a crime?\r\n\r\n  \r\nNot yet it isn't. But is this\r\nwhat it's come to for you?\r\n\r\n  \r\nExploiting tiny, helpless bees\r\nso you don't\r\n\r\n  \r\nhave to rehearse\r\nyour part and learn your lines, sir?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWatch it, Benson!\r\nI could blow right now!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis isn't a goodfella.\r\nThis is a badfella!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhy doesn't someone just step on\r\nthis creep, and we can all go home?!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Order in this court!\r\n- You're all thinking it!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOrder! Order, I say!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Say it!\r\n- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI think it was awfully nice\r\nof that bear to pitch in like that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI think the jury's on our side.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAre we doing everything right, legally?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm a florist.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRight. Well, here's to a great team.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTo a great team!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWell, hello.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Ken!\r\n- Hello.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI didn't think you were coming.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo, I was just late.\r\nI tried to call, but... the battery.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI didn't want all this to go to waste,\r\nso I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, that was lucky.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThere's a little left.\r\nI could heat it up.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo I hear you're quite a tennis player.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm not much for the game myself.\r\nThe ball's a little grabby.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's where I usually sit.\r\nRight... there.\r\n\r\n  \r\nKen, Barry was looking at your resume,\r\n\r\n  \r\nand he agreed with me that eating with\r\nchopsticks isn't really a special skill.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou think I don't see what you're doing?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know how hard it is to find\r\nthe rightjob. We have that in common.\r\n\r\n  \r\nDo we?\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees have 100 percent employment,\r\nbut we do jobs like taking the crud out.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's just what\r\nI was thinking about doing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nKen, I let Barry borrow your razor\r\nfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm going to drain the old stinger.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah, you do that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLook at that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou know, I've just about had it\r\n\r\n  \r\nwith your little mind games.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What's that?\r\n- Italian Vogue.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMamma mia, that's a lot of pages.\r\n\r\n  \r\nA lot of ads.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRemember what Van said, why is\r\nyour life more valuable than mine?\r\n\r\n  \r\nFunny, I just can't seem to recall that!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI think something stinks in here!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI love the smell of flowers.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow do you like the smell of flames?!\r\n\r\n  \r\nNot as much.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWater bug!

What are you talking about?!\r\nAre there other bugs in your life?\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo, but there are other things bugging\r\nme in life. And you're one of them!\r\n\r\n  \r\nFine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...\r\n\r\n  \r\nMy nerves are fried from riding\r\non this emotional roller coaster!\r\n\r\n  \r\nGoodbye, Ken.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd for your information,\r\n\r\n  \r\nI prefer sugar-free, artificial\r\nsweeteners made by man!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm sorry about all that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know it's got\r\nan aftertaste! I like it!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI always felt there was some kind\r\nof barrier between Ken and me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI couldn't overcome it.\r\nOh, well.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAre you OK for the trial?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI believe Mr. Montgomery\r\nis about out of ideas.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe would like to call\r\nMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.\r\n\r\n  \r\nGood idea!

The only thing I have\r\nto do to turn this jury around\r\n\r\n  \r\nis to remind them\r\nof what they don't like about bees.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You got the tweezers?\r\n- Are you allergic?\r\n\r\n  \r\nOnly to losing, son. Only to losing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you\r\nwhat I think we'd all like to know.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat exactly is your relationship\r\n\r\n  \r\nto that woman?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're friends.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Good friends?\r\n- Yes.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow good?

We're\r\njust a couple of bugs in this world.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat will the humans do to us\r\nif they win?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't know.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI hear they put the roaches in motels.\r\nThat doesn't sound so bad.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAdam, they check in,\r\nbut they don't check out!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, my.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOould you get a nurse\r\nto close that window?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Why?\r\n- The smoke.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees don't smoke.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRight. Bees don't smoke.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees don't smoke!\r\nBut some bees are smoking.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's it! That's our case!\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt is? It's not over?\r\n\r\n  \r\nGet dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.\r\n\r\n  \r\nGet back to the court and stall.\r\nStall any way you can.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Flayman.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYes? Yes, Your Honor!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhere is the rest of your team?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWell, Your Honor, it's interesting.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees are trained to fly haphazardly,\r\n\r\n  \r\nand as a result,\r\nwe don't make very good time.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI actually heard a funny story about...\r\n\r\n  \r\nYour Honor,\r\nhaven't these ridiculous bugs\r\n\r\n  \r\ntaken up enough\r\nof this court's valuable time?\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow much longer will we allow\r\nthese absurd shenanigans to go on?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey have presented no compelling\r\nevidence to support their charges\r\n\r\n  \r\nagainst my clients,\r\nwho run legitimate businesses.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI move for a complete dismissal\r\nof this entire case!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going\r\n\r\n  \r\nto have to consider\r\nMr. Montgomery's motion.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut you can't! We have a terrific case.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhere is your proof?\r\nWhere is the evidence?\r\n\r\n  \r\nShow me the smoking gun!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHold it, Your Honor!\r\nYou want a smoking gun?\r\n\r\n  \r\nHere is your smoking gun.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat is that?\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's a bee smoker!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat, this?\r\nThis harmless little contraption?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis couldn't hurt a fly,\r\nlet alone a bee.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLook at what has happened\r\n\r\n  \r\nto bees who have never been asked,\r\n\"Smoking or non?\"\r\n\r\n  \r\nIs this what nature intended for us?\r\n\r\n  \r\nTo be forcibly addicted\r\nto smoke machines\r\n\r\n  \r\nand man-made wooden slat work camps?\r\n\r\n  \r\nLiving out our lives as honey slaves\r\nto the white man?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What are we gonna do?\r\n- He's playing the species card.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLadies and gentlemen, please,\r\nfree these bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nFree the bees! Free the bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nFree the bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nFree the bees! Free the bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe court finds in favor of the bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nVanessa, we won!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI knew you could do it! High-five!\r\n\r\n  \r\nSorry.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm OK! You know what this means?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll the honey\r\nwill finally belong to the bees.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNow we won't have\r\nto work so hard all the time.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is an unholy perversion\r\nof the balance of nature, Benson.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou'll regret this.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, how much honey is out there?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll right. One at a time.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, who are you wearing?\r\n\r\n  \r\nMy sweater is Ralph Lauren,\r\nand I have no pants.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What if Montgomery's right?\r\n- What do you mean?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe've been living the bee way\r\na long time, 27 million years.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOongratulations on your victory.\r\nWhat will you demand as a settlement?\r\n\r\n  \r\nFirst, we'll demand a complete shutdown\r\nof all bee work camps.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThen we want back the honey\r\nthat was ours to begin with,\r\n\r\n  \r\nevery last drop.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe demand an end to the glorification\r\nof the bear as anything more\r\n\r\n  \r\nthan a filthy, smelly,\r\nbad-breath stink machine.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're all aware\r\nof what they do in the woods.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait for my signal.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTake him out.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe'll have nauseous\r\nfor a few hours, then he'll be fine.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd we will no longer tolerate\r\nbee-negative nicknames...\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut it's just a prance-about stage name!\r\n\r\n  \r\n...unnecessary inclusion of honey\r\nin bogus health products\r\n\r\n  \r\nand la-dee-da human\r\ntea-time snack garnishments.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOan't breathe.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBring it in, boys!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHold it right there! Good.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTap it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,\r\nand there's gallons more coming!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- I think we need to shut down!\r\n- Shut down? We've never shut down.\r\n\r\n  \r\nShut down honey production!\r\n\r\n  \r\nStop making honey!\r\n\r\n  \r\nTurn your key, sir!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat do we do now?\r\n\r\n  \r\nOannonball!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're shutting honey production!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMission abort.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAborting pollination and nectar detail.\r\nReturning to base.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAdam, you wouldn't believe\r\nhow much honey was out there.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, yeah?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat's going on? Where is everybody?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Are they out celebrating?\r\n- They're home.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey don't know what to do.\r\nLaying out, sleeping in.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way\r\nto San Antonio with a cricket.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAt least we got our honey back.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSometimes I think, so what if humans\r\nliked our honey? Who wouldn't?\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's the greatest thing in the world!\r\nI was excited to be part of making it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis was my new desk. This was my\r\nnew job. I wanted to do it really well.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd now...\r\n\r\n  \r\nNow I can't.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't understand\r\nwhy they're not happy.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI thought their lives would be better!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey're doing nothing. It's amazing.\r\nHoney really changes people.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou don't have any idea\r\nwhat's going on, do you?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What did you want to show me?\r\n- This.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat happened here?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat is not the half of it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, no. Oh, my.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey're all wilting.\r\n\r\n  \r\nDoesn't look very good, does it?\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd whose fault do you think that is?\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou know, I'm gonna guess bees.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees?\r\n\r\n  \r\nSpecifically, me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI didn't think bees not needing to make\r\nhoney would affect all these things.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's notjust flowers.\r\nFruits, vegetables, they all need bees.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's our whole SAT test right there.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTake away produce, that affects\r\nthe entire animal kingdom.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd then, of course...\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe human species?\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo if there's no more pollination,\r\n\r\n  \r\nit could all just go south here,\r\ncouldn't it?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know this is also partly my fault.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow about a suicide pact?\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow do we do it?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- I'll sting you, you step on me.\r\n- Thatjust kills you twice.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRight, right.\r\n\r\n  \r\nListen, Barry...\r\nsorry, but I gotta get going.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI had to open my mouth and talk.\r\n\r\n  \r\nVanessa?\r\n\r\n  \r\nVanessa? Why are you leaving?\r\nWhere are you going?\r\n\r\n  \r\nTo the final Tournament of Roses parade\r\nin Pasadena.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey've moved it to this weekend\r\nbecause all the flowers are dying.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's the last chance\r\nI'll ever have to see it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nVanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.\r\nI never meant it to turn out like this.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know. Me neither.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTournament of Roses.\r\nRoses can't do sports.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait a minute. Roses.

It's real.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThank you. It was a gift.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOnce inside,\r\nwe just pick the right float.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow about The Princess and the Pea?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI could be the princess,\r\nand you could be the pea!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYes, I got it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Where should I sit?\r\n- What are you?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- I believe I'm the pea.\r\n- The pea?\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt goes under the mattresses.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.\r\n- I'm getting the marshal.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou do that!\r\nThis whole parade is a fiasco!\r\n\r\n  \r\nLet's see what this baby'll do.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHey, what are you doing?!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThen all we do\r\nis blend in with traffic...\r\n\r\n  \r\n...without arousing suspicion.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOnce at the airport,\r\nthere's no stopping us.\r\n\r\n  \r\nStop! Security.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You and your insect pack your float?\r\n- Yes.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHas it been\r\nin your possession the entire time?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWould you remove your shoes?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Remove your stinger.\r\n- It's part of me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know. Just having some fun.\r\nEnjoy your flight.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThen if we're lucky, we'll have\r\njust enough pollen to do the job.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOan you believe how lucky we are? We\r\nhave just enough pollen to do the job!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI think this is gonna work.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's got to work.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAttention, passengers,\r\nthis is Oaptain Scott.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe have a bit of bad weather\r\nin New York.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt looks like we'll experience\r\na couple hours delay.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, these are cut flowers\r\nwith no water. They'll never make it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI gotta get up there\r\nand talk to them.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBe careful.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOan I get help\r\nwith the Sky Mall magazine?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'd like to order the talking\r\ninflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOaptain, I'm in a real situation.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What'd you say, Hal?\r\n- Nothing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBee!\r\n\r\n  \r\nDon't freak out! My entire species...\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat are you doing?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Wait a minute!

Does anyone onboard\r\nhave flight experience?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAs a matter of fact, there is.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Who's that?\r\n- Barry Benson.\r\n\r\n  \r\nFrom the honey trial?! Oh, great.\r\n\r\n  \r\nVanessa, this is nothing more\r\nthan a big metal bee.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's got giant wings, huge engines.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI can't fly a plane.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?\r\n- Yes.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow hard could it be?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait, Barry!\r\nWe're headed into some lightning.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is Bob Bumble. We have some\r\nlate-breaking news from JFK Airport,\r\n\r\n  \r\nwhere a suspenseful scene\r\nis developing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry Benson,\r\nfresh from his legal victory...\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's Barry!\r\n\r\n  \r\n...is attempting to land a plane,\r\nloaded with people, flowers\r\n\r\n  \r\nand an incapacitated flight crew.\r\n\r\n  \r\nFlowers?!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe have a storm in the area\r\nand two individuals at the controls\r\n\r\n  \r\nwith absolutely no flight experience.\r\n\r\n  \r\nJust a minute.\r\nThere's a bee on that plane.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson\r\nand his no-account compadres.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey've done enough damage.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut isn't he your only hope?\r\n\r\n  \r\nTechnically, a bee\r\nshouldn't be able to fly at all.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTheir wings are too small...\r\n\r\n  \r\nHaven't we heard this a million times?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\"The surface area of the wings\r\nand body mass make no sense.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Get this on the air!\r\n- Got it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Stand by.\r\n- We're going live.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe way we work may be a mystery to you.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMaking honey takes a lot of bees\r\ndoing a lot of small jobs.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut let me tell you about a small job.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIf you do it well,\r\nit makes a big difference.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMore than we realized.\r\nTo us, to everyone.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's why I want to get bees\r\nback to working together.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's the bee way!\r\nWe're not made of Jell-O.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe get behind a fellow.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Black and yellow!\r\n- Hello!\r\n\r\n  \r\nLeft, right, down, hover.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hover?\r\n- Forget hover.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis isn't so hard.\r\nBeep-beep! Beep-beep!\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, what happened?!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait, I think we were\r\non autopilot the whole time.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- That may have been helping me.\r\n- And now we're not!\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo it turns out I cannot fly a plane.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll of you, let's get\r\nbehind this fellow! Move it out!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMove out!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOur only chance is if I do what I'd do,\r\nyou copy me with the wings of the plane!\r\n\r\n  \r\nDon't have to yell.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm not yelling!\r\nWe're in a lot of trouble.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's very hard to concentrate\r\nwith that panicky tone in your voice!\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's not a tone. I'm panicking!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI can't do this!\r\n\r\n  \r\nVanessa, pull yourself together.\r\nYou have to snap out of it!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou snap out of it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou snap out of it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You snap out of it!\r\n- You snap out of it!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You snap out of it!\r\n- You snap out of it!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You snap out of it!\r\n- You snap out of it!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hold it!\r\n- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow is the plane flying?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't know.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHello?\r\n\r\n  \r\nBenson, got any flowers\r\nfor a happy occasion in there?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe Pollen Jocks!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey do get behind a fellow.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Black and yellow.\r\n- Hello.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll right, let's drop this tin can\r\non the blacktop.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhere? I can't see anything. Oan you?\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo, nothing. It's all cloudy.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOome on. You got to think bee, Barry.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Thinking bee.\r\n- Thinking bee.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThinking bee!\r\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait a minute.\r\nI think I'm feeling something.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What?\r\n- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLike a 27-million-year-old instinct.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBring the nose down.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThinking bee!\r\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What in the world is on the tarmac?\r\n- Get some lights on that!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThinking bee!\r\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Vanessa, aim for the flower.\r\n- OK.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOut the engines. We're going in\r\non bee power. Ready, boys?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAffirmative!\r\n\r\n  \r\nGood. Good. Easy, now. That's it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLand on that flower!\r\n\r\n  \r\nReady? Full reverse!\r\n\r\n  \r\nSpin it around!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Not that flower! The other one!\r\n- Which one?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- That flower.\r\n- I'm aiming at the flower!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.\r\nI mean the giant pulsating flower\r\n\r\n  \r\nmade of millions of bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nPull forward. Nose down. Tail up.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRotate around it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- This is insane, Barry!\r\n- This's the only way I know how to fly.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAm I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane\r\nflying in an insect-like pattern?\r\n\r\n  \r\nGet your nose in there. Don't be afraid.\r\nSmell it. Full reverse!\r\n\r\n  \r\nJust drop it. Be a part of it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAim for the center!\r\n\r\n  \r\nNow drop it in!

Let's just stop\r\nfor a second. Hold it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.\r\nOan we stop here?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm not making a major life decision\r\nduring a production number!\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll right.
